## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project, we will implement a 2-dimensional particle filter in C++. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step, the filter will also receive observation and control data. 

The localization information is used through a particle filter algorithm, comparing relative distances of landmark objects on the global map to those observed by the sensors. Subsequent predictions allow the car to be given a GPS location with a high degree of certainty, and the vehicle can be guided to the target destination depending on the error value observed.

## Running the Code
Once you have this repository on your machine, `cd` into the repository's root directory and run the following commands from the command line:

```
> ./clean.sh
> ./build.sh
> ./run.sh
```

> **NOTE**
> If you get any `command not found` problems, you will have to install 
> the associated dependencies (for example, 
> [cmake](https://cmake.org/install/))

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.


#### Control Data
`control_data.txt` contains rows of control data. Each row corresponds to the control data for the corresponding time step. The two columns represent
1. vehicle speed (in meters per second)
2. vehicle yaw rate (in radians per second)

#### Observation Data
The `observation` directory includes around 2000 files. Each file is numbered according to the timestep in which that observation takes place. 

These files contain observation data for all "observable" landmarks. Here observable means the landmark is sufficiently close to the vehicle. Each row in these files corresponds to a single landmark. The two columns represent:
1. x distance to the landmark in meters (right is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE. 
2. y distance to the landmark in meters (forward is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE.

> **NOTE**
> The vehicle's coordinate system is NOT the map coordinate system. Your 
> code will have to handle this transformation.

## Success Criteria
The two things that distinguish a successful recovery of the vehicle's location:

1. **Accuracy**: the particle filter should localize vehicle position and yaw to within the error values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` (maximum allowed error in x or y) and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`.
2. **Performance**: your particle filter should complete execution within a limited time specified by `max_runtime` in `src/main.cpp`.
